# Indonesian Stock Tools Web App

This repository consists of automation tools for me to analyize Indonesian stocks. It's also published on GitHub pages for anyone to use. Right now it only has a parser for IDX's 5% Ownership Docuemnt, but I plan to add more things in the future.

## How it works

- Users drag and drop a PDF on the page.
- The site parses directly in-browser with a JavaScript worker (`parser-worker.js`) and PDF.js.
- Browser and CLI parsing share the same header-driven JavaScript parser core.
- Results are rendered as grouped cards (Ticker + Owner + Sekuritas + totals).

No backend is required and uploaded files stay in the browser session.

## Local preview

Serve the repository with a local HTTP server (do not open `index.html` directly):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:8000`
