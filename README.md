# Indonesian Stock Tools Web App

This repository consists of automation tools for me to analyize Indonesian stocks. It's also published on GitHub pages for anyone to use. Right now it only has a parser for IDX's 5% Ownership Docuemnt, but I plan to add more things in the future.

## How it works

- Users drag and drop a PDF on the page.
- The site loads Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly).
- The existing `fivepercent.py` parser is loaded and executed in-browser.
- Results are rendered as grouped cards (Ticker + Owner + Sekuritas + totals).

No backend is required and uploaded files stay in the browser session.

## Local preview

Serve the repository with a local HTTP server (do not open `index.html` directly):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:8000`

## GitHub Pages deploy

A workflow is included at `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

1. Push to `master`.
2. In repository settings, set **Pages > Build and deployment > Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. The workflow deploys the site automatically.
